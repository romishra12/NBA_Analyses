# NBA_Analyses
This is a repository comprised of various projects on NBA Data, some of which will be done in R, and some in Python. 
At first, this project will be a way for me to practice Python, as a fluent R user.
As time goes on, I envision finding ways to leverage both Python and R to create data visualizations, develop new statistics, 
and answer interesting questions about the NBA.
